this is my day10 assignment where i was to display an outer div and inner div wher outer div acts as to change background color and inner div acts as to change the div sizes

here i added one buttons regarding to the outer div to change background color and one button to the inner div to change the sizes

in js file i have got the button with the help of ids and i added addEventListener to the respective buttons here we have to change multiple colors while clickig buttons which means everytime we click button new color should display so we have to use array with different colors and then i have given the indexing of the color to the outer div

similarly with the shape of the inner div also
